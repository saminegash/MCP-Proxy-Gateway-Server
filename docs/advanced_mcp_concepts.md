# Advanced MCP Concepts

This project treats the proxy as a full gateway in front of multiple Model Context Protocol servers.

## Gateway Features
- **Routing** – requests tagged with `/mcp/:target` are forwarded to the matching backend server.
- **Observability** – the gateway can log traffic and measure latency for each tool.
- **Extensibility** – adding a new server only requires registering its route and transport.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Each tool may expose sensitive operations.
- Assign roles (e.g., `reader`, `editor`, `admin`) and map them to permitted MCP methods.
- Enforce RBAC in the gateway before forwarding requests to servers.

## Streaming Interactions
- MCP supports streaming responses via Server-Sent Events or WebSockets.
- The gateway should proxy streaming channels so clients receive incremental data without buffering.
- Streaming is crucial for long-running tools and real-time updates.

A well designed gateway provides centralized policy enforcement while preserving the flexibility of individual MCP servers.
